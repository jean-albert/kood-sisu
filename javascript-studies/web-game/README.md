# web-game "Dodge Trunks" 🪵🚤🪙🚤❤️🚤

## Overview

"Dodge Trunks" is as simple multi-player only game. Rules are simple: with you little rowing boat, you must dodge the trunks floating on the river. You can collect coins during the game, and the number of coins is shown in real time on the leaderboard. The winner is determined by the highest coin count. Each player starts the game with three lives and if they get hit by obstacles they lose a life, if you run out of them you are out! Gather coins to increase your score and climb the leaderboard.

## Run the game
1. Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

2. Start the game server

```
npm start
```

The game can be accessed from http://localhost:3000

## Opening the game for multiplayer

For making the game "multiplayer", you can use for example 'ngrok' **or Cloudflare Tunnel (cloudflared)**. Simply split your terminal window and run the tunnel tool (ngrok or cloudflared) in parallel with your game server, as described below, to obtain a public URL.

### Option 1: ngrok
- Navigate to https://ngrok.com
Sign up and follow instructions to install the client based on your operating system: https://ngrok.com/download or use:

  ```
  npm install -g ngrok
  ```
  
- Continue the setup as instructed at https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/setup

- Because your server is launched at http://localhost:3000, use the command: 

  ```
  ngrok http 3000
  ```
That will give you an URL of the type: 'https://************.ngrok-free.app'

- Give this URL to your friends for them to join the game.

### Option 2: Cloudflare Tunnel (cloudflared)

- Install cloudflared:
  - [Download from official site](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/installation/)
  - Or via npm:
    ```
    npm install -g cloudflared
    ```
- Start a tunnel to your local server:
    ```
    npx cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:3000
    ```
- After a few seconds, you will see a public URL like:
    ```
    https://your-tunnel-id.trycloudflare.com (eg. https://identical-thailand-choir-architecture.trycloudflare.com)
    ```
- Share this URL with your friends so they can join your game from anywhere!

## Game Rules

- **Goal:**  
  Dodge the floating trunks **🪵** and collect as many coins **🪙** as possible! The player with the most coins at the end wins. 

- **Obstacles (Trunks 🪵):**  
  Floating trunks **🪵** are the main danger. If your boat collides with a trunk, you lose one life **❤️** and become temporarily invincible.

- **Lives ❤️:**  
  Each player starts with **3 lives** (❤️❤️❤️). Colliding with a trunk **🪵** or obstacle costs one life. If you lose all your lives, you can no longer collect coins or interact. If only one player remains alive, the game ends immediately. This behavior is implemented in accordance with the requirements: "Your game must be playable by between 2 and 4 players." and "The game supports multiplayer with 2, 3 or 4 players."

- **Bonuses:**  
  - **Shield 🛡️:** Grants 15 seconds of immunity to collisions.
  - **Heart ❤️:** Pick up hearts to restore lost lives (up to 3).
  - **Coin 🪙:** Increase your score and leaderboard position.

- **Collision Immunity 🛡️:**  
  After each collision with a trunk **🪵**, your boat becomes invincible for **5 seconds** (visual effect).  
  You can also gain **15 seconds of immunity** by collecting a **shield bonus** 🛡️.

- **Host 👑:**  
  The first player to join is the host and can start or restart the game. If the host leaves, a new host is assigned automatically. **The host can choose the duration of the round before starting the game.**

- **Pause & Menu:**  
  Press `Esc` or the **Pause** button to open the menu. You can pause, restart, or quit the game. The name of the player who initiates these actions is shown to all.

## Game Modes

- **💰Coins:** The goal of this mode is to collect as many coins as possible. The game continues until only one player remains or the time set by the host runs out.

- **❤️Survival:** The goal of this mode is to stay alive. The game continues until only one player remains. The speed of the logs increases every 20 seconds.

  - When a player collects a heart (extra life), a floating '+1' appears above their avatar.
  - When a player collects a shield, a floating hint '🛡️ 15 seconds of immunity' appears above their avatar, making the bonus effect clear and visually engaging.
  - When a player loses a life (e.g., collides with a trunk), a floating '💔' appears above their avatar, and the avatar briefly shakes for extra feedback.
- **Smooth Animations:** All floating hints and key events are accompanied by smooth CSS animations for a modern, responsive feel.
